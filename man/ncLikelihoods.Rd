\title{Example profile likelihoods for negative control outcomes}
\format{
An object of class \code{list} containing 12 lists, where each list includes
several dataframes ith column \code{point} and \code{value} for adaptive grid profile likelihoods.
}
\usage{
ncLikelihoods
}
\description{
A list that contain profile likelihoods a large set of negative control outcomes.
They are extracted from a real-world observational healthcare database, with the
likelihoods profiled using adaptive grids using the \code{Cyclops} package.
